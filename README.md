# Full Page

A page with divs to force full height on desktop browsers. Primarily created to use for making walk-throughs for 
articles on my development and design website playground http://designkojo.com

Note: there is no reset included at present. This is good for experimenting as it makes you familiar with browser agent defaults. If you are building something for production I do suggest using a rest. I am still out on the best reset so I am not going to suggest on here. Search CSS reset on DuckDuckGo ðŸ¦† if you are unsure what a reset is.
